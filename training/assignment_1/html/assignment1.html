		<p>
			HTML (the Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two of the core technologies for building
			Web pages. HTML provides the structure of the page, CSS the (visual and aural) layout, for a variety of devices.
			Along with graphics and scripting, HTML and CSS are the basis of building Web pages and Web Applications. CSS is the
			language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt
			the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is
			independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. The separation of HTML from CSS makes it
			easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across pages, and tailor pages to different environments. This is
			referred to as the separation of structure (or: content) from presentation. XHTML is a variant of HTML that uses the
			syntax of XML, the Extensible Markup Language. XHTML has all the same elements (for paragraphs, etc.) as the HTML
			variant, but the syntax is slightly different. Because XHTML is an XML application, you can use other XML tools with
			it (such as XSLT, a language for transforming XML content).

				In order to begin to write HTML, it helps if you know what you are writing. HTML is the language in which most
				websites are written. HTML is used to create pages and make them functional. The code used to make them visually
				appealing is known as CSS and we shall focus on this in a later tutorial. For now, we will focus on teaching you
				how to build rather than design.

				CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This
				separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of
				presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a
				separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.

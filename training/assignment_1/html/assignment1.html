		<p>
			HTML (the Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two of the core
			technologies for building Web pages. HTML provides the structure of the page, CSS the
			(visual and aural) layout, for a variety of devices. Along with graphics and scripting,
			HTML and CSS are the basis of building Web pages and Web Applications. CSS is the language
			for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows
			one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens,
			or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.
			The separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across pages,
			and tailor pages to different environments. This is referred to as the separation of structure
			(or: content) from presentation. XHTML is a variant of HTML that uses the syntax of XML,
			the Extensible Markup Language. XHTML has all the same elements (for paragraphs, etc.)
			as the HTML variant, but the syntax is slightly different. Because XHTML is an XML application,
			you can use other XML tools with it (such as XSLT, a language for transforming XML content).

			<p>
				In order to begin to write HTML, it helps if
				you know what you are writing. HTML is the language in which most websites are written. HTML is
				used to create pages and make them functional. The code used to make them visually appealing is known
				as CSS and we shall focus on this in a later tutorial. For now, we will focus on teaching you how to build
				rather than design.

			<h3 class="headings">Learn CSS</h3>
			<p> CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors,
				and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control
				in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
				specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural
				content.
